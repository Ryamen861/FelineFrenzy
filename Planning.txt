# all of the things to buy in the store (in order of price, lowest -> highest)
- plastic bottle
- scratchy cardboard box
- plushy toy
- ball around and around
- feather on a string
- tube
- cat palace (set of boxes, high up places)
- catnip forest

Pre-Code Plan Breakdown
- implement random cat visiting mechanism
    - make rectangles onto the screen for the toys to be
        - make maybe 4-5 max spaces
        - in these rectangles, the toy images can be placed
- implement currency
    - when the toy is bought, do a "are you sure you will spend {this much}"?
- set up the shop, stock the shop
    - (when item button (in store) is clicked:
        - see if it is buyable
        - if it is, ask for confirmation, then buy
        - if it isn't, then say sorry, they can't)
- cat book to see all of the cats met so far
- daily math puzzle for coins
- save changes

ESTIMATED TIMELINE
    day1- find graphics, set up the screen
    day2- set up buttons to navigate home<-->store
    day3- Added items to store
    day4- worked on functionality of random cats coming and going
    day5- revised cat-visiting mechanism with pygame.time.Clock()
    day6- status (coins, XP, level) and how they are changed by cats visiting
    day7- buying items from the store, asking for confirmation, attempt at adding 'where to put' functionality
    day8- make spot Objects and SpotManager, revise when to ask the confirmation window
    day9- make Cat Object, finish 'where to put' functionality, make icons/images transparent
        (changing these into objects took a lot of work, revising and going over logic, getting stuck,
           I should have done this from the start. I nearly did, but I had trouble setting out the layout of the class and
           how to control it, so I didn't)
    day10 (1/3/23)- figure out the weird infinite while loop in insert_toy (modify the SpotManager class, add a new func)
        Also added the feature where when you buy something and place it at a spot where there is already a toy, then
        replace the old toy with the new one
        Also added a feature where it checks if you already bought something or not

    day11 (2/12/23) implement enums, match statements for state of the GUI
        Also implemented Cat Book

    day12 (3/5/23) added the level label
        - debugging labels
        - made check_new_level more accurate
    day13 (3/19/23) implemented the new_level_congratulations functionality
