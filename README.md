# FelineFrenzy
FelineFrenzy is a game where you have a yard where cats can visit.

## Objective
To unlock all of the cats

## How the Game Works
Different cats will come to your yard. That will give you XP.
When they leave, they will tip you some coins. With those coins, you can buy more cat toys.

More XP will result in unlocking new levels, unlocking more cats.
